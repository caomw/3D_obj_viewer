ObjViewer is a sample Android application illustrating various aspects
of using OpenGL-ES 3D graphics:
  * GeomBuilder: basic management of 3D object geometry and rendering
  * ObjReader: simple reading of common .obj-format model files and
    associated .mtl material-definition files
  * Rotation: generation of 3D rotation transformations using unit
    quaternions
  * ObjectView: basic on-screen display of a 3D model with simple
    lighting, allowing interactive rotation to any orientation, and
    also demonstrating animated rotations

Copy the .obj file that you want to view (and associated .mtl file, if
any) onto a directory named “Models” on the SD card of the Android
device. It should then appear in the list that is shown when you
select “Open...” from the options menu in ObjViewer.

You can interactively adjust the orientation of the object by dragging
across the view; drag across the middle part to rotate about the X
(horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes, and drag around the periphery to
rotate about the Z axis (perpendicular to the view) as well.

To see any colours that might be defined for the surfaces of your model,
turn on lighting.

If parts of the surface of the object seem to disappear, try switching
the order of vertices in a forward-looking face under “Orient Faces...”.

“Reset View” animates rotating the object back to its initial orientation.
“Random View” animates rotating the object to a random orientation.

If you want to find downloadable models to view, here are a couple of
lists of likely websites:
<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Sources_of_free_3D_models>
<http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Tutorials/Resources/Models>.

If you want to create your own models, Blender <http://www.blender.org/>
is an amazing package, well worth at least getting a basic understanding
of how to create simple models and scenes with it. But don’t try to learn it
on your own; you’ll find plenty of tutorials to get you started--just
follow the links from the Blender site.
